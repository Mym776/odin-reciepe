    <p>Scrambled eggs is a dish made from eggs (usually chicken eggs), where the whites and yolks have been stirred, whipped, or beaten together (typically with salt, butter or oil, and sometimes water or milk, or other ingredients), then heated so that the proteins denature and coagulate, and they form into "curds".[</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>All-purpose flour</li>
        <li>milk</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First, beat the eggs. Place them in a medium bowl, and whisk until the yolk and whites are thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Next, gently preheat the pan. Brush a small nonstick skillet with olive oil, or melt a little butter inside it. Warm the skillet over medium heat</li>
        <li>Finally, cook. Pour in the egg mixture, and let it cook for a few seconds, undisturbed. Then, pull a rubber spatula across the bottom of the pan to form large, soft curds of scrambled eggs.
            Continue cooking over medium-low heat, folding and stirring the eggs every few seconds. As you work, make sure to scrape your spatula along the bottom and sides of the pan to continue to form curds and to prevent any part of the eggs from drying out.
            For a soft, creamy scramble, stop when the eggs are mostly set, but a little liquid egg remains. Remove the pan from the heat, and season to taste with salt and pepper.
            Thatâ€™s it! The whole process will be over in under 5 minutes.</li>
